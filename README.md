# WaniKani is cool, but its SRS is hardly configurable

This is a small program that queries WaniKani's API for kanji subjects and adds them to a local Anki deck using the Anki
Connect API.

**Why?**: I'm living in Japan for a year, and for my own interest I would like to out-pace the default timing of
WaniKani. Picture this: WaniKani's maximum pace will let you run through the entirety of the 60 levels in just under a
year, but I would love to go faster. Besides, I have previously reached level 52, but reset by account after a longer
break. Moving my content over to Anki will let me do this while keeping the WaniKani-style learning experience.
